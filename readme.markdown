# Mustache.cfc

Chris Wanstrath's [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) templates for [ColdFusion](https://github.com/pmcelhaney/Mustache.cfc).

## Installation

Mustache is a single component. To install, download the Mustache.cfc file from the mustache directory.

## Basic Usage

    <cfset mustache = createObject("component", "Mustache").init()>
    <cfset template = "Hello, {{thing}}!">
    <cfset context = structNew()>
    <cfset context['thing'] = 'World'>

    <cfoutput>#mustache.render(template, context)#</cfoutput>

## Creating Views
                
Given a template named Winner.mustache:
    
    Hello {{name}}
    You have just won ${{value}}!
    {{#in_ca}}
    Well, ${{taxed_value}}, after taxes.
    {{/in_ca}}

And a view named Winner.cfc:

    <cfcomponent extends="Mustache">
      <cffunction name="taxed_value">
        <cfreturn this.value * 0.6>
      </cffunction>
    </cfcomponent>
                                   
You can render the view like so:

    <cfset winner = createObject("component", "Winner")>
    <cfset winner.name = "Patrick">
    <cfset winner.value = "1000">
    <cfset winner.in_ca = true>
    <cfoutput>#winner.render()#</cfoutput>
     
Result:
    
    Hello Patrick
    You have just won $1000!
    Well, $600, after taxes.

A custom tag is also included so you can render templates like so:

    <cfset context = {
        name = "Patrick",
        value = 1000,
        in_ca = true,
        taxed_value = 600
    } />

    <cfimport taglib="/path/to/mustache/dir" prefix="stache" />
    <stache:mustache context="#context#">
    <cfoutput>
    Hello {{name}}
    You have just won ${{value}}!
    {{##in_ca}}
    Well, ${{taxed_value}}, after taxes.
    {{/in_ca}}
    </cfoutput>
    </stache:mustache>
    
## Testing
